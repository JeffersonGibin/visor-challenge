# Visor Challenge

This project is part of *Visor's  recruiting process*. Below you can find a description of the challenge, the architecture I used and all the warehouses involved.

### Challenge:

 Develop a chat app should be able to send messages through an input area, then draw those same messages in a chat as well as the automatic answers from the algorithm.


### What it needs to do:
- write messages;
-send messages;
-receive answer messages every time a message is sent.

**Note:** The complexity of the development is up to the developer's capabilities and knowledge. The way the challenge is tackled will determine the participant's level and role.

**There are a few restrictions:**
- only use JavaScript & Javascript frameworks;
- must have back-end and front-end logic;
- if a database is created for this purpose, it should be a non-relation database. Besides this, feel free to make the best of your skills in this exercise but take into consideration.


**Some tips:**
- write clean code;
- create a well organised project;
- use good code practices;
- make sure the logic is explained in the best way possible.
